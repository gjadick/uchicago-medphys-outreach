# Within folder MRI:
## RunMe
Main MRI Code to Run. 
Be able to... 
1. Visualize C chord as waves with certain frequencies (major C, E, G) 
2. Visualize fourier transform that we perform to hear the individual notes
3. Introduction to planar waves and fourier domain in 2D and connection to sound waves
4. See planar wave and FT as it rotates
5. See planar wave and FT as it rotates and changes frequency
6. watch image construction of an MRI brain scan as k-space is collected
7. See comparison between the guitar C chord and the MRI image

## PlanarWave_FFT
Shows how frequency, orientation, and phase is shown in 2D fourier space.

Distance from center = frequency\
Angle from horizontal =  tilt \
Complex portion = phase 



## Scratch
This took an image of a brain and showed reconstruction of the image through superposition of 2d planar waves of varying frequencies and the corresponding location of those in k-space. The pickle files were saved in a data folder to save computation time and energy.
