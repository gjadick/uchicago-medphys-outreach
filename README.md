## PlanarWave_FFT
Shows how frequency, orientation, and phase is shown in 2D fourier space.

Distance from center = frequency\
Angle from horizontal =  tilt \
Complex portion = phase 


## PrepCode
This took an image of a brain and showed reconstruction of the image through superposition of 2d planar waves of varying frequencies and the corresponding location of those in k-space. 
The pickle files were saved in a data folder to save computation time and energy.
